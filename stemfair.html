      <h1>This is 2024 STEM FAIR PAGE</h1>
      <h2>The project I made for 2024 stem fair is smart city. I worked on making smart city and designing the buliding in the city. I hope you enjoy my project and have fun by looking my website. </h2>
      <h3>Ask: A smart city may minimize energy consumption and air pollution, which is now one of the major issues in the world, as well as make the city more convenient.</h3>
      <h3>Imagine: Our goal was to create a comfortable city for its residents, while still providing many of the services that are necessary in larger cities. We also made an effort to create a city with lower air pollution.  </h3>
      <h3>Plan : We created a design that is small in scale but offers a wide range of services.  Our primary goal in creating the small-scale city was to construct each component that was given to us and put the finished product together.  </h3>
      <h3>Create : In our smart city we have made air pollution sensor to check if the air quality.  As you see the design of our smart city we tried to make many services such as department store, sport courts, and apartment. </h3>
      <h3>Improve : After making the smart city we thought more detailed designs. Also we thought making more eco-friendly or convenient services in the smart city which would have made the city to be better. But, we all mostly have done the best effort we can and made the result of what we wanted.</h3>
